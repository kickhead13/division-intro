Each directory (source1, source2, source3) has a Makefile that builds an executable... Your challenge is to make a bash script that builds all these executables and runs them sequentially... You must also report if any of them exit abnormaly (exit with an exit code other than 0). Feel free to hard code stuff... this shouldn't be production grade...
